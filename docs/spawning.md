# Registry-driven spawning

This repo now uses a data-first spawning system:

- `data/spawn_registry.lua`: declarative types, defaults, and variants
- `spawning/spawner.lua`: reads the registry, resolves type/variant for each Tiled object, merges configs, and calls factories
- `spawning/factories/*.lua`: small adapters to construct live entities

See also: [Writing factories](./factories.md)

## How it works

1. In Tiled, put spawnable objects in the `entity` object layer.
2. For each object:
  - Name-only matching is used. The object name must start with a known prefix (box/ball/bell)
    and the full name must match an existing variant (e.g., `box1`, `ball2`, `bell1`).
  - If the name doesnâ€™t match a declared variant, the object is skipped.
3. The spawner merges config in this order:
  - per-type defaults (from `registry.types[type].defaults`)
  - per-variant presets (from `registry.variants[type][variant]`)
  - `object.properties` (from Tiled)
4. The resolved config is passed to the factory `create(world, x, y, obj, cfg, ctx)`.

## Extend with a new type

- Add a factory: `spawning/factories/spike.lua` exporting `create(world, x, y, obj, cfg, ctx)`
- Register the type in `data/spawn_registry.lua`:

```
  types = {
    spike = { factory = 'spawning.factories.spike', defaults = { lethal = true } },
  }
  variants = {
    spike = {
      spike1 = { w = 16, h = 8 },
    }
  }
  rules = {
    { when = { namePrefix = 'spike' }, type = 'spike', variant = { fromName = true } },
  }
```

Now drop an object named `spike1` or set `type=spike` in Tiled.

## Integration details

- `map.lua` now calls `Spawner.spawn(world, layer.objects, { registry, level, map })`
- Results are assigned to `state.boxes`, `state.balls`, `state.bells` for compatibility
- The old presets table in `map.lua` was removed; use `data/spawn_registry.lua` instead

## Factory contract

A factory module returns a table with `create(world, x, y, obj, cfg, ctx)`.

- `world`: love.physics World
- `x, y`: center coordinates computed from the Tiled object
- `obj`: full Tiled object (with `.name`, `.type`, `.properties`, `.width`, `.height`)
- `cfg`: merged configuration from registry + variant + obj.properties
- `ctx`: extra context: `{ registry, level, map }`

Return the live instance (table/object). If your project already has an entity module,
require and delegate to it from the factory.

## Notes

- SaveState overlays are applied before spawning, so factories can read updated properties
- You can keep using `obj.name` to distinguish specific singles (e.g., `bell1`)
- To debug, print from factories or extend the registry with additional flags
